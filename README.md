Organized by China Mobile, the side meeting will focus the following two areas:


1. AI for network operations: We will continue the discussion on previous AI4Net side meeting regarding using AI to improve network operations.


2. Network optimization for AI inference: The success of the Deepseek —the first open-source(MIT license!) model with performance comparable to top-tier proprietary models— attracts many new players to AI inference optimization. We will discuss how network devices can contribute to optimizing and accelerating AI inference processes.
